Socialscience is an open-source project aimed at providing ready-to-use scripts for data analysis in social sciences. This repository includes statistical analyses commonly used in sociology, psychology, and political science. Each script is designed to work with real or simulated datasets, demonstrating various statistical methods and their interpretations.

Key features of the project include:
Data cleaning and preprocessing scripts
Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests, regression models)
Advanced modeling techniques (e.g., multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, mediation and moderation, etc.)
Visualization of results with graphs and tables
Step-by-step explanations and documentation for each analysis
The repository is structured to be accessible for both beginners and advanced researchers, offering practical examples and reproducible workflows. I want you to know that contributions are welcome to expand the range of analyses and improve existing scripts.

Let's make social science research more transparent, reproducible, and efficient!
